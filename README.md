## Project Description

For our unit03 project, we are creating a clone of the popular productivity app [Trello](https://trello.com/). Users sign up and login with a custom username and password and then are taken to a mobile, tablet, and desktop application where they can add a board. In each board, they can add a card that holds a list of items tied to the specified card. Each user utilizes CRUD (i.e. create, read, update, and delete) functionality to manipulate each card and/or board on a backend server created and maintained by Ruby on Rails and SQL. 

For this project, I am creating an app that allows an administrator to login, create a quiz and assign point values to each question, distribute the quiz to other users, automatically grade each quiz, and have a running tally of points accrued based on each quiz answer. Regular users will be able to login, enter their name, see the quiz that the administrator distributed, answer each question, receive results, and see their total points based on the administrators point distribution.
